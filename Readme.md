# Clubber
Clubber is a Discord bot that primarily handles score roles in the DD Pals server. It does this by communicating with Sorath's servers to check if a registered user needs updating. This procedure happens once a day but users can choose to invoke it for themselves anytime using a command. Clubber has other features like the ability to post welcome messages or show the statstics of a player's personal best.
